//VkDesignerUtil.setEngine(); -- if you would like to change attributes and their application to widgets
//VkDesignerUtil.setMenu(vkMenu) -- in case you would like to change the Menu items
}}}

====3. Dependencies====

*Do remember to include [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-structs/downloads/detail?name=JsBridge-0.0.2.jar&can=2&q= JsBridge] and [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-structs/downloads/detail?name=autocompleter_1.0.2.jar&can=2&q= Combobox] in your classpath

For Event handling UI, it requires codemirror library be placed in war. Check out from the following location [http://code.google.com/p/vkgwtdesigner/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FVkGwtDesigner%2Fwar%2Fcodemirror%253Fstate%253Dclosed codemirror]

====4. Run the application====

NB: Currently, the uploaded version only works with *Mozilla FF* predictably.

1. Right click for options for each widget

2. To add javascript for event handlers,

    a. click on a widget, to popoulate its id in the textarea e.g. (&4) 

    b. Treat this id as element and invoke javascript functions or attributes e.g. (&4).innerHTML = new Date(); 

3. Style dialog applies styles as and when it changes to give a WYSIWYG feel.
